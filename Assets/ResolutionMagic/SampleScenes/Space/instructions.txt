SpacePortrait demo scene

This scene demonstrates the camera movement. 

When you first open the scene, please change the game resolution to a portrait size, e.g. 3:2 portrait. This simulates a vertical space shooting game.

The 'zoom type' button switches between zooming to canvas and zooming to maximum size. You'll notice extra content visible when zoomed to maximum size.

Move the camera via the keyboard arrow keys.

Note that with 'Restrict Screen to Background' selected you can't move the camera far enough to show content outside the background. 
Disable this setting to see the difference (you will be able to scroll beyond the background and see 'dead space' where there is no game content).
