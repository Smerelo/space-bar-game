Black Bars example

This sample scene shows how to use the Black Bars prefab.

The Black Bars prefab has one use: to force the same content to display regardless of the screen shape.

If the screen shape is different to the content shape (determined by the canvas), black bars will display along two edges of the screen (left/right or top/bottom).

This works just like when you watch an old 4:3 TV show on a widescreen TV.

Only use this feature if you need all players to see exactly the same content; otherwise use Resolution Magic normally and let players with wider/taller screens see more content.

How to use:

Simply add the Black Bars prefab as a child to the camera. The script on the prefab has a toggle, which is turned on by default. You can also turn the black bars off and on via the
main ResolutionManager script (but only if the prefab is attached to the camera).
